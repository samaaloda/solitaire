# Solitaire

## **Description:**
The game consists of a foundation, tableau, and stock pile. The objective is to 
organizeall cards on the foundation in ascending order (A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,A,Q,J,K) by 
their respective symbol. You can move cards from and to foundation to main, however players can
only move cards from the stock. To move a card in the tableau, cards must be of descending order,
and a different colour (Spades and Clubs are black, while Hearts and Diamonds are red). Cards in 
the tableau will be unhidden once the card in front of it is exposed. 

Good luck playing! However, be careful, since the game may not be solvable. The cards are
randomly positioned, and according to Solitaire by MobilityWare, about 80% of randomized Solitaire 
games are solvable.
